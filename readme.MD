# TIX

This game is heavily inspired by the arcade game Qix. But due to the limited graphics capabilities of the TI-99/4A home 
computer I have chosen to use character graphics rather than pixel graphics for plotting the path of the player.   

Then project was started in September 2019. 

## System requirements

A TI-99/4A computer with 32K memory expansion.

## Building the game

The xdt99 cross-development tools are required to build the game.
See https://github.com/endlos99/xdt99

Java is required to build the cartridge version.

On Windows, run make.bat to build the cartridge and disk versions.

## Running the game

There are 2 options for running the game:

* With 16K cartridge, FlashROM99, FinalGROM99, or emulators: Burn and run tix8.bin (non-inverted).
* With 32K expansion and disk system: Run E/A#5 DSK1.TIX.

## Playing the game

You can play the game using a joystick only. Fire to move faster. Loo at the intro for tips.

## License

The code and game is free to use for non-commercial purposes. You are not allowed to sell this game without my permission.
